# vittodevit-classic
Second iteration of my personal portfolio.   
This version is currently live on the main domain [vitto.dev](https://vitto.dev) waiting to be substituted with the v3.

Reasons for the migration to the v3:
- Plain old simple HTML is really lightweight but very difficult to mantain.
- I wanted to integrate a headless CMS, so i'm moving to Gatsby.
- I love Bootstrap5 but the style came out kinda old and boring.
- No international (english) version, only italian.
